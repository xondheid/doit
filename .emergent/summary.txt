The AI engineer successfully initiated development of a universal medical platform, prioritizing the core aha moment of appointment booking. Following a detailed plan covering authentication, service management, and appointment systems, the foundational code for both frontend (React with Tailwind CSS) and backend (FastAPI with MongoDB) was generated using . Dependencies like  for authentication were installed. The backend's critical user authentication and core API endpoints were thoroughly tested, with all 25 tests passing, validating the initial functionality. A screenshot confirmed the frontend's live status. The previous engineer's immediate action was to pause and ask for user approval to proceed with frontend testing, which was subsequently granted. This trajectory demonstrates a systematic, test-driven approach to delivering an MVP.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a universal medical platform to consolidate medical general practice users, supporting web, Android, and iPhone interfaces with a unified backend and comprehensive frontend. The primary functionality is to enable users to reserve offline appointments for trivial medical services such as recipes, sick notes, vaccinations, or wound dressing. The platform must also support dynamic extension of available services and management of time availability for patient visits. The initial build by the AI engineer established core components: a multi-role user authentication system (Patients, Doctors, Admins) and foundational scaffolding for dynamic medical services and appointment booking, aiming to deliver a basic yet functional appointment booking experience.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS (for UI).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based system,  for password hashing.
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor (process manager).
-   **Service Communication:** Frontend uses , Backend uses . All backend API routes must be prefixed with .
-   **Development:**  for initial code generation.

<code_architecture>
The project adheres to a standard full-stack structure:

-   : This file was completely rewritten to establish the FastAPI backend. It now includes comprehensive user authentication routes (registration, login for patients, doctors, and admins), database models, and initial API endpoints for managing medical services and appointments. It handles database connections via  and implements CORS policies.
-   : This main React component was entirely rewritten to build the user interface. It contains the core routing and components for the universal medical platform, including user login and registration forms, and basic layouts for displaying services and appointment functionalities. It integrates with the backend via .
-   : This file provides the styling for the frontend application. It was also rewritten to include global and component-specific styles, likely utilizing Tailwind CSS classes, to create the functional but beautiful base UI.
-   : This file lists all Python dependencies.  was added here and installed, indicating its use for secure password hashing within the backend's authentication system.
-   : This file is crucial for tracking testing progress and protocols. It was updated by the AI engineer to reflect the successful completion and passing status of all backend tests.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement full Dynamic Service Management (CRUD, categorization, pricing) and its Admin interface.
-   Complete Appointment Booking System logic (time slot management, conflict resolution, detailed status tracking).
-   Develop comprehensive Patient, Doctor, and Admin Dashboards.
-   Decide on and implement external authentication providers (e.g., Google, Apple).
-   Define and implement specific requirements (duration, forms, pricing) for different appointment types.
-   Implement email notifications for appointments.
-   Perform frontend testing.

<current_work>
The universal medical platform currently has a robust foundational build. The backend, running on FastAPI, features a complete user authentication system with multi-role support (Patients, Doctors, Admins). This includes secure user registration and login functionalities. Initial API endpoints for dynamic medical services and appointment booking have been scaffolded. On the frontend, a React application with a functional and aesthetically pleasing UI is live, displaying the landing page and providing login/registration interfaces.
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer used  to establish this core application, installed  for password hashing, and restarted the backend. A screenshot confirmed the frontend's live status. Most importantly, the backend was rigorously tested using , and all 25 tests related to user authentication and core API endpoints passed successfully. The product is currently at a state where the backend's core functionality is validated, and the frontend is visually accessible, awaiting frontend test initiation.
